# synco

A tool to synchronize the contents of directory with maildir mailbox.

## Description

There are many options to sync files across machines. Some of the are open source and other require using a third party service. synco takes a different approach. synco alone is not enough to sync files across machines. One would need another tool to sync maildir mailboxes across machines. I use synco to sync my notes across machines. Given that I already sync my mail box across machines, it felt natual to piggyback file synchronization on top of IMAP.
